# Syllabus and News for CS540: Advanced Software Engineering

* **Course:** [COSCS-540]
* ** MWF 09:15AM-10:05AM  (Min Kao 405) and over zoom
  https://tennessee.zoom.us/j/99540828537  **
* **Instructor:** Audris Mockus, [audris@utk.edu](mailto:audris@utk.edu) office hours MK613 - on request

The primary purpose of the course is to learn-by-doing multiple advanced
software engineering techniques including:
1. Software Supply Chains
1. Open source software development
1. Software measurement
1. Software tools
1. Basics of Big Data inclding shell scripting
1. Basics of the cloud computing
