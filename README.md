# Syllabus and News for CS540: Advanced Software Engineering

* **Course:** [COSCS-540]
* ** MWF 09:15AM-10:05AM  (Min Kao 405) and over zoom
  https://tennessee.zoom.us/j/99540828537  **
* **Instructor:** Audris Mockus, [audris@utk.edu](mailto:audris@utk.edu) office hours MK613 - on request

The primary purpose of the course is to learn-by-doing multiple advanced
software engineering techniques including:
1. Software Supply Chains
1. Open source software development
1. Software measurement
1. Software tools
1. Basics of Big Data inclding shell scripting
1. Basics of the cloud computing
1. Advanced software process

The semester-long group project will involve building an
